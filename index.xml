      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to describe a testing technique that lays a foundation for an alternative to stubbing that I often find superior. Contract test&amp;rsquo;s can be applied to all levels of testing, but in this post im going to describe them in the context of unit testing where i personally often use them to define and verify the behavior of an API. The concept of a Contract Test is not new.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer working in the financial industry in Stockholm, Sweden. I&amp;rsquo;m a big proponent of test driven development, although i try to avoid being dogmatic. I don&amp;rsquo;t think there’s one true way to develop software. Different styles suit different needs. Whether a given practice is appealing is highly subjective. For me, TDD really helps me in many of my everyday programming tasks. I will probably write a fair amount of posts about how I do TDD.</description>
