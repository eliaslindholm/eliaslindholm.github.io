      <description>In this post I’m going to describe a testing technique that I often find superior to mocking and stubbing. Contract test&amp;rsquo;s and lightweight implementations applies to all level of testing, but in this post im going to describe it in the context of unit testing where i personally use it a lot to define and verify the behavior of an API. The concept of a Contract Test is not new. I first read a about it in the &amp;ldquo;JUnit recipies&amp;rdquo; book sometime during the last decade, although the author didn’t define them as Contract Tests back then, but rather a teqnique for testing abstract types (abstract classes and interfaces in Java).</description>
